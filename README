This is some basic php code that checks a pachube data feed for data about a room's
power consumption, looks to see if it's above a threshhold, and responds with a
a simple html page telling you if anyone's in the room (and using an above-baseline amount of power)

We're getting our power data via a current sensor that Julian Lee clipped around
the power mains in the building, and he put in an arduino with a ethernet shield
to send the data periodically to pachube.

Here's the tech specs:
1) Power consumption of the space, based on the design from openenergymonitor.org, using a SCT-13-000 clip-on CT sensor attached to the main fuse box. (Code courtesy of openenergymonitor.org) 
2) Temperature and humidity of the space, using a DHT11 digital temperature sensor. (Code courtesy of sheepdogguides.com)

And here's our pachube feed:
